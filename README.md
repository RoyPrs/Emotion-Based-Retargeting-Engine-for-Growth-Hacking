# Emotion-Based-Retargeting-Engine-for-Growth-Hacking

## Overview

This growth hacking experiment focuses on leveraging **emotion analysis** to segment users and personalize marketing campaigns. The goal is to improve **retention**, reduce **churn**, and increase **engagement** by responding to users based on their emotional tone.

---

## Objective

To design and implement a data-driven retargeting engine that:

* Detects customer emotions using NLP.
* Segments users accordingly.
* Delivers personalized follow-up messages.
* Measures performance across different emotional cohorts.

---

## Tools Used

* **Python**, **Hugging Face Transformers**
* **LSTM model (TensorFlow)**
* **CountVectorizer**, **Scikit-learn**
* **Google Colab**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**
* **Power BI / Metabase** for visualization

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

* Scraped anonymized customer reviews and support feedback.
* Collected 10,000+ text entries labeled with timestamps, source, and customer ID.

### 2. Emotion Detection

* Applied fine-tuned transformer model (`bhadresh-savani/bert-base-uncased-emotion`).
* Classifies text into: Joy, Anger, Fear, Sadness, Love, Surprise.

### 3. User Segmentation

* Mapped emotions to use-cases:

  * Joy / Love → Promotion / Referral
  * Anger / Fear → Recovery Campaigns
  * Sadness → Support + Encouragement
  * Surprise → New Feature / Curiosity-based Offers

### 4. Campaign Personalization

* Created 4 email templates tailored to emotions.
* Used Jinja templating in Python for automation.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics

* Open Rate
* Click-Through Rate
* Conversion Rate
* Retention Over 30 Days

## Results Snapshot

| Emotion | CTR Increase | Retention Boost | Notable Insight                    |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Joy     | +15%         | +22%            | Great timing for upsells           |
| Sadness | +12%         | +19%            | Kind tone improves brand sentiment |
| Anger   | +8%          | +14%            | Recovery + human response was key  |

---

## Takeaway

Emotion-based segmentation can significantly outperform generic campaigns. It's a powerful tool when integrated with behavioral data, particularly for churn-prone users.

---

## Future Directions

* Add real-time emotion detection to chat and email pipelines.
* Expand emotion model to include sarcasm and mixed tones.
* Integrate with CRM and customer journey maps for live tracking.
