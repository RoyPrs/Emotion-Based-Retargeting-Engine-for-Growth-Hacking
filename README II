# Emotion-Based Retargeting Engine for Growth Hacking

## Overview

As part of my growth hacking portfolio, I designed and developed an **Emotion-Based Retargeting Engine**â€”an innovative application of NLP and machine learning to boost customer engagement by understanding the emotional tone of user-generated content.

---

## Objective

To classify customer emotions from text data (e.g., product reviews, support tickets, social media comments) and use the emotional insights to tailor retargeting strategies that improve user retention, re-engagement, and satisfaction.

## My Role

* Data Analyst & NLP Developer
* Concept Creator and End-to-End Executor

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NLTK)
* **Hugging Face Transformers**
* **CountVectorizer**, **TF-IDF**, **GloVe Embeddings**
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Power BI** for Visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**, **Google Colab**, **GitHub** for development and versioning

---

## Key Features & Methods

* **Multi-class Emotion Classification** using Logistic Regression and LSTM models
* **Cross-Validation** to evaluate model performance (89% test accuracy)
* **Embedding Layer with GloVe** to capture semantic meaning
* **EarlyStopping & Dropout Layers** to prevent overfitting

---

## Growth Hacking Impact

By identifying the **emotional state** of users (e.g., joy, anger, fear, sadness), we could:

* Design **personalized retargeting messages** based on sentiment
* Trigger **automated customer support** workflows
* Re-engage churned users with empathy-driven copywriting
* Create **emotion-based user segments** for A/B testing

---

## Outcome

* Achieved **89% model accuracy** in detecting 6 emotional categories
* Created a prototype for **emotion-driven campaign automation**
* Added to GitHub portfolio with full code and README
